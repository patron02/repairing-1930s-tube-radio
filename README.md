Repairing my great great grandpa's tube radio

I received the radio in really bad condition because it had been packaged and shipped from Brazil to the USA. The circuit was broken, the wood had termites and was chipped, the fabric was ripped, the speaker was damaged, and the buttons did not work.

The glass on the radio had broken so we got some glass custom made and installed it where the old glass was. We also replaced the torn fabric with some new fabric that we found online. 

I started repairing the circuit by first soldering all the components that had fallen off. I replaced the broken tubes with new ones and fixed the ground connection on the radio. Because the radio was manufactured and used in Brazil it was set to operate at a voltage of 220V. I had to use a voltage converter to switch it to the US standard of 120V.
