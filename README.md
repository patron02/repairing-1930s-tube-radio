Repairing my great great grandpa's tube radio

This project is still a work in progress...

I received the radio in really bad condition because it had been packaged and shipped from Brazil to the USA. The circuit was broken, the wood had termites and was chipped, the circuit was broken, the fabric was ripped, the speaker was damaged, and the buttons did not work.

I worked on repairing this radio with my mom. I called my grandpa for advice on repairing the circuit since he had modified it, and I also asked an electrical engineering professor for information on radio tubes and speakers. The first thing we did was completely gut the radio and repair the wood. We used sprays to kill the termites and let it sit overnight. After we were sure it was clean, we filled in the broken parts with plastic wood and applied varnish.

The glass on the radio had broken so we got some glass custom made and installed it where the old glass was. We also replaced the torn fabric with some new fabric that we found online. 

I started repairing the circuit by first soldering all the components that had fallen off. I replaced the broken tubes with new ones and fixed the ground connection on the radio. Because the radio was manufactured and used in Brazil it was set to operate at a voltage of 220V. I had to use a voltage converter to switch it to the US standard of 120V. I also had to add an outlet converter since the outlets in Brazil are shaped differently. 

The speaker had to be repaired and cleaned but the quality of sound was not very good. I opted to keep it instead of installing a new one because I wanted to keep the radio as original as possible.

The radio worked for a while but the capacitors need to be changed for new ones and I plan on installing an arduino add on to allow for bluetooth devices to be connected. It is very difficult to finish fixing the radio because the parts are very old and outdated, there is no schematic, and the broken parts must be custom designed and 3D printed. I will finish fixing it once I have gathered and bought all the necessary parts. For now it's a nice piece to have around the house.
